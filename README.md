## Macro Sentiment Indicator
The main goal of this project is to learn how to deal with bunch of indicators data. We need to read data from different files, pre-process them (clean noise, fill missing values) and eventually explore these data trying to find useful information to build a sentiment indicator for various asset classes (e.g. commodity, index). We then implement a basic strategy to verify our indicator.
